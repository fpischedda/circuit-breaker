# circuit-breaker

A Clojure library that implements the [circuit breaker design pattern](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circuit_breaker_design_pattern)

```clj
[circuit-breaker "0.0.0"]

```

> name needs to change, there is already a circuit-breaker library on Clojars,
> maybe, fpischedda.circuit-breaker or info.pischedda.circuit-breaker?

## Usage

This library provides two ways to wrap a function with a circuit breaker:
- Exception based
- Based on the return value of the wrapped function (richer API)

### Exception based example

``` clj

(require '[circuit-breaker.core :as cb])

(defn to-be-wrapped [a b]
  (/ a b))

(def wrapped (cb/make-circuit-breaker {:wrapped-fn to-be-wrapped
                                       :max-retries 2
                                       :retry-after-ms 10}))

;; happy case
(wrapped 2 2) ;; => {:status :closed :value 1}

;; failing case, retry max-retry times and wait retry-after-ms before retrying
(wrapped 2 0) ;; => {:status :open :retry-after 10}

;; wrapped start to work again, we are in the semi-open state now
(wrapped 4 2) ;; => {:status :semi-open :value 2}

;; fail again, but this time it does not retry
(wrapped 2 0) ;; => {:status :open :retry-after 10}

```

### Return based example

``` clj

(defn to-be-wrapped [result]
  result)

(def wrapped (cb/make-circuit-breaker {:wrapped-fn to-be-wrapped
                                       :max-retries 2
                                       :retry-after-ms 10}))

;; happy case
(wrapped {:result :ok :value 1}) ;; => {:status :closed :value 1}

;; failing case, retry max-retry times and wait retry-after-ms before retrying
(wrapped {:result :soft-failure
          :retry-after (in-a-minute)}) ;; => {:status :open
                                       ;;     :retry-after :same-date-time}

;; wrapped start to work again, we are in the semi-open state now
(wrapped {:result :ok :value 2}) ;; => {:status :semi-open :value 2}

;; fail again, but this time it does not retry
(wrapped {:result :soft-failure
          :retry-after (in-a-minute)}) ;; => {:status :open
		                               ;;     :retry-after :some-date-time}

```

Return based approach, so far, seems very close to the exception based one,
if we exclude the possibility, for the wrapped function, to tell exactly until
when the circuit must stay open; this method provides and additional result
key :hard-failure which will open the circuit without retrying to call the
wrapped function.
This can be convenient, for example, in case an external API has a quota,
it does not make any sense to call the external API again if we have exceed
our quota.

``` clj

(cb/reset wrapped)  ;; reset the circuit to its initial state

;; fail hard this time, so it does not retry
(wrapped {:result :hard-failure
          :retry-after (tomorrow)}) ;; => {:status :open
		                            ;;     :retry-after :some-date-time}

```

## TODO

- get feedback: is it useful? missing something?
- better name of the namespace and put everything on clojars
- eventually apply the return based method to exceptions
- better documentation
- def-circuit-breaker macro?
